## Project Overview
## **Historical Context**

The Faculty of Physics at the University of Havana traces its origins back to the **1962 University Reform**, which led to the creation of the School of Physics as part of the Faculty of Sciences. This marked a turning point, granting Physics recognition as an **independent academic discipline**, distinct from the previously unified specialties of Physical-Mathematical and Physical-Chemical Sciences, which had been present in the university’s curriculum since the early 20th century.

In **1984**, the School of Physics was elevated to the rank of Faculty, establishing itself as a national reference in scientific training. Over the past 60 years, it has produced hundreds of graduates who have contributed to the field both in Cuba and abroad, through diverse career paths that reflect rich and complex personal and professional trajectories.

Some alumni have remained in academia, while others have transitioned into different sectors, taking their training to new contexts. Understanding these diverse journeys — and what drives them — is the **central aim of this research project**.

## **Origins of the Research Idea**

This project began as a **personal and academic curiosity**: *What happens to Physics graduates in Cuba? Where are they now? Have they continued in academia? If not, why did they leave, and when?*

From this question emerged the idea to systematically examine the **academic and professional paths** of Physics graduates. Beyond enrollment and graduation statistics, we are interested in the **motivations behind choosing this career** and the factors that shape long-term decisions.

The project seeks to answer questions like:

- What drives students to choose Physics?  
- Do early dreams and expectations influence persistence in academia?  
- Are there gender-based patterns in career choices or academic departures?  
- What role do social, personal, and economic factors play?

## **Methodology**

We use a **mixed-methods approach**, combining quantitative data with qualitative insights. Our methodology includes:

- Document review of academic records  
- Semi-structured interviews with alumni  
- Online surveys for broader data collection  
- Statistical analysis and thematic categorization to identify patterns

## **Feasibility and Scope**

The relatively small size of the Faculty and its defined historical period (since **1962**) make this study **feasible**. With careful outreach, it is possible to locate and engage with a significant number of graduates. The creation of a **database** will support both this and future research stages.

## **Preliminary Results: Promotions from 2010 to 2024**

Our initial data collection has focused on graduates from **2010 to 2024**, using information gathered from **professional and social networks**. While this data is still being refined, it already reveals notable diversity in career paths and migration patterns.

These preliminary results offer a **first glimpse** of the project's potential to document and analyze the real-life implications of studying Physics in Cuba.

To explore these early findings in detail, visit the [Promotions 2010–2024](/Promotions_2010_2024/) page.

This early sample will serve as a **foundation for comparison** as more cohorts are incorporated, and as interviews and surveys deepen our understanding of how **identity, gender, and context** shape long-term professional outcomes.
