## Promotions 2010-2024

This section presents a preliminary analysis of the academic and professional trajectories of Physics graduates from the University of Havana between 2010 and 2024.

The data has been collected through professional and social networks and currently includes information on **193 graduates**. While the sample is still being refined, it provides a valuable snapshot of recent cohorts.

We begin here with a **general overview** of all graduates in this period, followed by focused analyses where the data is segmented by:

- **Gender**
- **Current country or region of residence**
- **Highest academic degree achieved**

These breakdowns aim to highlight patterns in career paths, geographic mobility, and academic progression. This information will serve as the basis for identifying trends and developing further research questions about how various factors shape the long-term outcomes of Physics graduates in the Cuban context.

### General Overview

Between 2010 and 2024, a total of **193 graduates** completed their bachelor/engineer studies at the Faculty of Physics, University of Havana. The average number of graduates per year is 12.8, with extremes ranging from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 20 graduates. The peak of 20 graduates occurred in both 2015 and 2016, coinciding with the largest graduating classes of the Engineering in Physics program—a second discipline offered at the faculty from 2007 to 2012. The lowest number of graduates was recorded in 2024, corresponding to the cohort that began their bachelor's studies just before the pandemic, in September 2019.

Key findings from this cohort include:

- **Gender distribution**: 78.24% male and 21.76% female graduates overall, with year-by-year variations.
- **Geographic location**: Approximately 24.35% of graduates currently reside **in Cuba**, while 69.95% are living **abroad**. For a 5.18% there are no available data on their current place of residence.
- **Academic trajectory**:
  - At least 47.06% of those graduted before 2020 have completed a **doctoral degree (PhD)**. For this estimation, we only considered the promotions before 2020 because the youngest doctor of we know of finished the bachelor in that year. Nevertheless, in this case, for a 30.88% there are not infirmation on the continuity or not of their academic education.  
  - Approximately 58.03% remain **active in academia or research institutions**. This includes those who are pursuing a master or a doctor degree.
- **Industry placement**: Approximately 26.42% of graduates are working **in the private or public sector outside academia**, including technology, education, and industry. Around a 5.39% dedicates to other activities and for a 10.36% there are no available data on their current occupation.

These general figures provide a starting point for more detailed analyses, which explore how career outcomes correlate with factors such as gender, location, and academic advancement. 

## Gender Overview

This section analyzes not only the overall gender distribution but also how it varies across graduation years and correlates with geographic location and employment.

### Year-by-Year Gender Trends

The number of male and female graduates varies from year to year, with male graduates consistently outnumbering female graduates—except in 2011. Despite these annual fluctuations, the gender distribution remains relatively stable, with an average ratio of approximately one woman for every three men. This 25–75% female-to-male proportion is below the global average. According to UNESCO's Science Report 2021, women represent nearly one in three researchers worldwide.

### Gender and Geographic Location

Male graduates are more likely to reside abroad compared to female graduates, who show a higher proportion remaining in Cuba. These trends provide insights into gender-related mobility patterns.

### Gender and Academic Employment

There is a noticeable correlation between gender and current employment in academia, with male graduates slightly more represented among those active in academic or research institutions.

Further analyses will explore these relationships in detail to better understand gender dynamics within the professional trajectories of Physics graduates.
