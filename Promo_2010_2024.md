## FF-UH Promotions 2010-2024

This section presents a preliminary analysis of the academic and professional trajectories of Physics graduates from the Faculty of Physics at the University of Havana (FF-UH) between 2010 and 2024.

The data has been collected through professional and social networks and currently includes information on **193 graduates** as of June 2025. 

We begin here with a **general overview** of all graduates in this period, followed by focused analyses where the data is segmented by:

- **Gender**
- **Current country or region of residence**

These breakdowns aim to highlight patterns in career paths, geographic mobility, and academic progression. This information will serve as the basis for identifying trends and developing further research questions about how various factors shape the long-term outcomes of Physics graduates in the Cuban context.

### General Overview

Between 2010 and 2024, a total of **193 graduates** completed their bachelor/engineer studies at the Faculty of Physics, University of Havana. The average number of graduates per year is 12.8, with extremes ranging from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 20 graduates. The peak of 20 graduates occurred in both 2015 and 2016, coinciding with the largest graduating classes of the Engineering in Physics program—a second discipline offered at the faculty from 2007 to 2012. The lowest number of graduates was recorded in 2024, corresponding to the cohort that began their bachelor's studies just before the pandemic, in September 2019.

</div>

Key findings from this cohort include:

- **Gender distribution**: 78.24% male and 21.76% female graduates overall, with year-by-year variations.
- **Geographic location**: Approximately 24.35% of graduates currently reside **in Cuba**, while 69.95% are living **abroad**. For a 5.18% there are no available data on their current place of residence.
- **Academic trajectory**:
  - At least 47.06% of those graduted before 2020 have completed a **doctoral degree (PhD)**. For this estimation, we only considered the promotions before 2020 because the youngest doctor of we know of finished the bachelor in that year. For a 30.88% of the graduates there are not information on the continuity or not of their academic education.  
  - Approximately 57.51% remain **active in academia or research institutions**. This includes those who are pursuing a master or a doctor degree.
- **Industry placement**: Approximately 21.77% of graduates are working **in the private or public sector outside academia**, including technology, education, and industry. Around a 5.39% dedicates to other activities and for a 10.36% there are no available data on their current occupation.

These general figures provide a starting point for more detailed analyses, which explore how career outcomes correlate with factors such as gender, location, and academic advancement. 

## Gender Overview

This section analyzes not only the overall gender distribution but also how it varies across graduation years and correlates with geographic location, education and employment. 

The number of male and female graduates varies from year to year, with male graduates consistently outnumbering female graduates—except in 2011. Despite these annual fluctuations, the gender distribution remains relatively stable, with an average ratio of approximately one woman for every three men. This 25–75% female-to-male proportion is below the global average. According to [UNESCO's Science Report 2021](https://www.unesco.org/reports/science/2021/es/dataviz/women-share), women represent nearly one in three researchers worldwide.

However, once they are graduated, the statistics for men and women does not look so different. 

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Category</th>
      <th>Men (%)</th>
      <th>Women (%)</th>
      <th>Difference (Women − Men) (%)</th>

**Table 1.** Percentage Distribution of Graduates by Gender, Residence, and Professional Path. Percentages are calculated based on the number of graduates with known responses in each category for each gender, excluding those with missing data.

As shown in the table, the percentage difference between men and women never exceeds 10%, indicating no seemingly significant gap. We also performed both a Z-test and a Chi-square test for each category. All the computed p-values exceeded the 0.05 threshold, suggesting that the observed differences in proportions between men and women could be due to random variation. The sample sizes were adequate for these tests, supporting the reliability of these conclusions. In summary, this analysis found no evidence of gender disparities in the path after graduation within the studied categories in this dataset. 
This conclusion challenges the commonly held belief in the existence of a “leaky pipeline” effect for women in STEM — the idea that the persistence of prejudices, stereotypes, and gender discrimination leads to a higher dropout rate among women as they progress through the academic path. On the contrary, our data shows that the percentage of graduates who remain in academia is similar for both men and women. Of course, this measure is time-sensitive, and the current dataset has limitations, as the individuals analyzed are still relatively young and not yet at the typical age of stabilization within academic institutions. Therefore, it would be valuable to expand the dataset to include earlier cohorts of graduates in order to assess how this phenomenon evolves over time.

## Country or Region of Residence

Of the **193 graduates**, only **24.35%** are known to be currently residing in **Cuba**, while **69.95%** live **abroad**. For **5.18%** of graduates, no information is available regarding their current location, those are showed in Figure 4, but excluded from the rest of the analysis. These figures suggest a high degree of international mobility among the graduates from this period.

Figure 4 highlights the progressive increase in the proportion of graduates living outside of Cuba over time. This trend likely reflects broader economic and academic migration patterns, especially in the context of expanding global opportunities for advanced study and employment, and Cuban migrational crisis. Althought this analysis is based on available data and may be subject to incomplete information, the overall pattern aligns with informal accounts of high rates of academic and professional migration among Cuban STEM graduates.

Figure 5 shows the distribution of graduates by geographical region, with Europe being the region that gathers the higest percentage of them. However, Figure 6 reveals that the countries with the highest concentration of physics graduates, apart from Cuba, are the United States and Spain. This aligns with the fact that, for many decades, these have been the preferred destinations for Cuban emigrants.

The impact of geographic dispersion on professional engagement is higher compared to that of gender, as we can appreciate from Table 2.

**Table 2.** Percentage Distribution of Graduates by Residence and Professional Path. Percentages are calculated based on the number of graduates with known responses in each category, excluding those with missing data.

Let us first note that graduates living abroad are significantly more likely to hold a PhD compared to those residing in Cuba. Among those with valid data, 56.7% of graduates living abroad have a PhD, while only 16.7% of those in Cuba do. This 40 percentage point gap is statistically significant (Z-test p = 0.0001, Chi-squared p = 0.0002), and the sample size is sufficient to support the reliability of the result. This disparity may reflects the greater access to doctoral programs and further work opportunities abroad in contraposition to the limited opportunities for advanced academic training and profesional development within the island.

The attempt to perform the Z- and Chi-square tests for the rest of the categories in Table 2 reveals that the data is insufficient for a good statistical analysis with those metrics. Therefore, the interpretation of these results should serve more as a guide for identifying potential trends and informing future, more comprehensive studies rather than as a solid basis for drawing definitive conclusions at this stage. 

Anyhow, we would like to highlight that, as far as we know, none of the graduates from the analized period currently residing in Cuba work in industry. This reflects the lack of opportunities and the existence of structural barriers within a country facing strong economic challenges and with limited industrial infrastructure. In fact, if we focus on the data for PhD holders (Table 3), we can immediately note that all of those living in Cuba work in academia, while for those abroad the employment panorama is wider, with only half in academia and about 30% in industry. This reinforces our previous conclusions, although, again, the lack of data prevents us from drawing further implications.

**Table 3.** Percentage Distribution of Graduates with a PhD by Residence and Professional Path. Percentages are calculated based on the number of graduates with known responses in each category, excluding those with missing data.

These glimpses of possible patterns underscore the importance of geographic context in shaping professional trajectories and further support the view that the observed differences should be interpreted as early signals rather than definitive findings. They point to important questions about brain drain and sectoral employment dynamics that merit deeper, more targeted investigation.
