## Promotions 2010-2024

This section presents a preliminary analysis of the academic and professional trajectories of Physics graduates from the University of Havana between 2010 and 2024.

The data has been collected through professional and social networks and currently includes information on **[insert number] graduates**. While the sample is still being refined, it provides a valuable snapshot of recent cohorts.

We begin here with a **general overview** of all graduates in this period, followed by focused analyses where the data is segmented by:

- **Highest academic degree achieved**

These breakdowns aim to highlight patterns in career paths, geographic mobility, and academic progression. This information will serve as the basis for identifying trends and developing further research questions about how various factors shape the long-term outcomes of Physics graduates in the Cuban context.

### General Overview

Between 2010 and 2024, a total of **[X] graduates** completed their studies at the Faculty of Physics, University of Havana.
