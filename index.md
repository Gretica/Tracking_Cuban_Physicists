Welcome to the Scattering Cimarrón webpage! 

This project investigates the academic and professional trajectories of graduates from the Faculty of Physics at the University of Havana in Cuba. It aims to understand what motivates individuals to choose this career path, which factors influence their decision to remain in or leave the academic field, and how personal, social, and economic expectations play a role. 

Through interviews, surveys, and document analysis, the project seeks to build a database that helps identify common patterns. It also aims to compare these trajectories with international experiences to understand how the Cuban context aligns with or differs from global trends.
